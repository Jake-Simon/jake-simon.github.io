    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Hello, my name is Jake Simon.  My pronouns are they/them.  I am an intern at FilmAcademy360, a filming program of the Academy360 Upper School, in Livingston, New Jersey.  During my time there, I have contributed to editing and filming projects for other companies, as well as planning throughout the entire production process of my own videos produced by them.<br>
        My education consists of a Bachelor's degree with a major in Media Studies, with an HONORS degree in Social Science from William Paterson University.  I also take sessions in Game-U for drawing and game development.<br>
        Other projects I worked on include editing for Star Giant Productions under the name SageFroppy and I also work with a team on another gaming project consisting of a project-manager and a few Game-U students like myself.</p>

        <h3>Guggenheim Crew</h3>
        <p>This video gives an example of how I am able to work outside of the FilmAcademy360 studio when filming for clients.  It shows me doing tasks such as checking that the crew has all the equipment before leaving, holding a camera held by a Gimbal Stabilizer when filming, and making sure no other bystander interrupts the main project.</p>

    <h3>My Uber Experience</h3>
    <p>This is a documentary about me taking Uber from my house to FilmAcademy360 and William Patterson for my daily routine.  It shows how I use Uber to get to work and college instead of driving myself, while still being productive with my day-to-day life.  This video was filmed before Covid-19 and it was originally going to be used for Uber company as advertisement;  unfortunately they declined the offer as Covid-19 became prominent and I was not wearing a mask, which would not have been good for the company's publicity at the time.  This was also before I started to identify as non-binary, so the other people being interviewed were referring to me with masculine pronouns.</p>
