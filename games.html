    <h1>Video Game Creation</h1>
    <h2>(In Progress)</h2>
    <p class = "Work_Contribution center">I have used Unity since 2021 as my software for game development, which utilizes C# for scripts.  This has been used for my game development classes in Game-U.  I have also gotten the opprotunity to work with student game development teams to better understand the work process of cooperation.</p>
    <!--<h2>One-Armed Outlaw</h2>
    <p class = "Work_Contribution center">One-Armed Outlaw is a "Mega Man" style platformer that has a western setting.  It is a team project which I have started contributing since August 2022 and my contributions mainly involve minor coding and formatting a main menu placeholder at the beginning of the game.  One of my biggest contributions is creating the title screen placeholder and the player being able to cross slopes. <!--For more detail about my contributions, you can view the GitHub repository <a href = "https://github.com/VGRenegade/One-Armed-Outlaw">here</a>.</p>-->
    <h2>2D Project (Title Pending)</h2>
    <p class = "Work_Contribution center">This is the first game project I have made for myself using Unity.  It is a 2D platformer in a similar artistic style to "Thomas Was Alone", but with only 12 levels to go through.  Some of the enemies are even inspired by those from Super Mario Bros. games.  I have worked on the entirety of the game from start to finish with the help of a game development instructor.</p>
