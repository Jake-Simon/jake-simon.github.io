        <h2>Extracurricular Digital Sketches</h2>
        <p class = "Work_Contribution center">I have started drawing digitally since early 2021 when I got my first Wacom tablet for my class at Game-U.  I draw using the SketchBook application of 2D models.  I mainly do animal sketches, which are mainly taken from other images in google and redraw my own replications of them.</p>

            <div id = "Black Dragonfish">
                <div class = "sketch">
                    <img class = "drawing" src="Drawings/Black%20Dragonfish/Black%20Dragonfish%20concept4.png">
                    <p>This is my attempt at drawing a unique looking fish called the dragonfish.  It is a practice sketch of me trying to draw different perspectives of how the dragonfish can be drawn.</p>

                    <img class = "drawing" src="Drawings/Tardigrade/Tardigrade%20concept%20final1.png">
                    <p>This is my attempt at drawing a unique looking creature known as a tardigrade, or water-bear.  I tried to focus on different aspects of the tardigrade such as the claw and the head to express different features of the tardigrade.</p>

                    <img class = "drawing" src="Drawings/Speedshoes/Hedgehog%20concept2.png">
                    <p>This is my first attempt of creating my own persona/avatar.  It's meant to portray a running shoe that can transform into a hedgehog, which was inspired by objects from the One Piece anime being able to turn into animals after "eating" a Zoan Devil Fruit.</p>

                    <img class = "drawing" src="Drawings/Potato%20sketching1.jpg">
                    <p>This is my first attempt at creating caricatures using various images.  I found an image of different potato head outlines for heads and created expressive faces and other features such as hair, accessories, and ears.  One of my favorite potato heads in the one whose head looks like a basketball.</p>

        <h2>Graphics</h2>
        <p class = "Work_Contribution center">Throughout some of my time in Spectrum Works, I have worked on different graphic designs projects using Photoshop.  I have mainly done projects that can be considered practice projects if I were to do graphic design professionally.  This projects include creating posters, flyers, and business cards.</p>

                    <img class = "graphic" src = "savory.png">
                    <p>For this assignment, I made four flyer options for a fictional restaurant named ADLU.  The first option shows a food plate with different food groups for a balanced diet, the second displays social and environmental needs, the third presents options of cakes, and the last provides a background that makes the food seem savory.</p>

                    <img class = "graphic" src = "Cars 4.png">
                    <p>These are fake movie posters that are indicative as potential continuations of Hamilton, Shrek, and Cars. These posters indicate a new musical with Jefferson as the focus founding father, Shrek going on a world tour, and a human being able to go inside vehicles.  Note for the Shrek poster, I made this before the announcement of Shrek 5.</p>

                    <img class = "graphic" src = "Logo_3.png">
                    <p>I made three logo options for a fictional illustrator named "Michelle Gobiel."  To format her profession as an illustator, I made the background choices be either be lined paper, a notepad, or a sticky note.</p>

                    <img class = "graphic" src = "Mother's Day.png">
                    <p>This assignment required me to make five different greeting cards, each being for a separate occassion.  Based on the holidays around the time I made the cards, the cards are directly for Arbor Day, Mother's Day, Birthday, Wedding Anniversary, and wishing for someone to get well.  The left side of the graphic displays the cover of the card, while the right side of the graphic displays a short poem that would be inside of the card.</p>

                    <img class = "graphic_project" src = "Dollar Tree.png">
                    <p>I made a fake advertisement for Dollar Tree with a Saint Patrick's Day theme.  I arranged images of Dollar Tree's Saint Patrick's Day products into the shape of a smile, and across the top I put a holiday poem, acting as a hat for it.  The poem relates to how inexpensive products are at Dollar Tree, as everything is "nearly a buck".</p>
