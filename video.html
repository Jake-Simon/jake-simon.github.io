This is the first video I learned to properly use the clipshow background by adjusting the video clips into the projector screen-like border.  Some edits that use IPs she does not own have been re-edited by her, most noticeably scenes of <i>Amphibia</i> in <i>The Owl House</i> portion, and some parts of the <i>Moon Girl and Devil Dinosaur</i> portion.</p>

                    <h3>Highest Grossing Animated Films Ranked</h3>
                    <p>This is Rebeccah's 10th anniversary video for the Star Giant Productions channel where she ranks the top 50 highest grossing animated films from <i>How to Train Your Dragon 3</i> with about $525 million to <i>The Lion King</i> (2019) with at least $1.66 billion, in terms of preference.  It is also the biggest project I made a contribution to in terms of general video length I edited for, being almost 57 minutes.  Note that the films she ranks are based on her findings in January of 2023, even though the video was released in December of the same year. As such, she does not explain her rankings with <i>The Grinch</i> (2018), <i>The Super Mario Bros. Movie</i> (2023), or <i>Spider-Man: Across the Spiderverse</i>.  My sections deal mostly with what Disney currently owns, but I have edited segments talking about the DreamWorks films <i>Shrek the Third</i> and <i>Madagascar</i>.  One of my noticeable edits is incorporating the King Crimson (JoJo's Bizarre Adventure) effects in <i>The Lion King</i> segment I edited at 0:42:26.</p>

Other than the Spy Ã— Family portion I worked in the Best of 2023 video, this is my first video of hers to edit talking about an anime.  I mainly edited the fifth part of her video.  A notable contribution to the video was animating a pin to look like it was thrown on an image, with an additional sound effect added.  I also edited the pin being removed at 34:22 of the video.</p>

                    <p>This video showcases an edit I made for the <i>Frozen II</i> segment in a previous video discussing the Kids Choice Awards. Although this particular edit is unused for that video, it was graciously posted on Rebeccah's secondary channel. When she asked if there were any original films from 2019, I made the choice to show six films based on non-original animated series. This edit highlights the absence of nominations for original animated movies at the 2020 Kids Choice Awards.</p>

Rebeccah ranks the movies from Madagascar (awarded in 2006) to Minions: Rise of Gru (awarded in 2023).  The channel owner wanted me to make a collage in the intro on every announcement of the winner for the animated movies; but I can only find the announcements from 2006, 2007, 2012, and 2020. I also ended the intro with Mario (filmed in 2016 award show) in it as potential winner for 2024.</p>

Compared to other editors, most of my sections are soundtracks from Kingdom Hearts games (which are also Disney properties).  One of the most interesting things I edited was in the Hercules portion where the first 10 seconds of the ranking was creating an Allen Tsai parody where I cropped visuals of a clip to look more like it would be viewed from a phone in vertical orientation, and add text from what was spoken inside a black textbox. </p>

                    <h3>Jake's Animated Review Show: One Piece</h3>
                    <p>This is my review of the <i>One Piece</i> anime.  The video was made as a result of the anime reaching over 1000 episodes.  One interesting thing I have added to the series was the intro being similar to the SpongeBob theme song.</p>

                    <h3>Jake's Animated Review Show: Cells at Work</h3>
                    <p>This is my animated review on <i>Cells at Work!</i>, mainly the first season.  It was made as a result of the pandemic being widespread and Cells at Work is an anime about explaining what happens inside the human body.</p>

                    <h3>Kaan's Green Goddess Smoothie</h3>
                    <p>This is a cooking video created by Kaan, another FilmAcademy360 student, where he makes a Green Goddess Smoothie.  Within the first few weeks of my internship in FilmAcademy360, I was given this project as an assignment to help edit Kaan's video by focusing on the best portions of each clip and cutting to the next shots to have them flow well together.</p>
