    <h2>Star Giant Productions Contributions</h2>
        <p class = "Work_Contribution center">Star Giant Productions is a YouTube channel owned by Rebeccah Starlight.  Her videos mostly involve ranking and reviewing Western Animation based on a specific topic.  I work as one of several editors for her channel since November 2021 under the name SageFroppy.</p>

                    <h3>Why Companies Hate Originality</h3>
                    <p>This is a response video to Paramount's announcement that they would not make any original franchises for at least a few years, and critiques on the ideology of media companies heavily relying on established intellectual properties over original ones.  This is also the first video I fully edited without having it adjusted whatsoever.</p>

                    <h3>Weathering With You Review</h3>
                    <p>This is Rebeccah's review about the CoMIX Wave film Weathering With You.  Other than the Spy × Family portion I worked in the Best of 2023 video, this is my first video of hers to edit talking about an anime.  I mainly edited the fifth part of her video.  A notable contribution to the video was animating a pin to look like it was thrown on an image, with an additional sound effect added.  I also edited the pin being removed at 34:22 of the video.</p>

                    <h3>Unused Frozen II edit for Kids Choice Awards video</h3>
                    <p>This video showcases an edit I made for the Frozen II segment in a previous video discussing the Kids Choice Awards. Although this particular edit is unused for that video, it was graciously posted on Rebeccah's secondary channel. When she asked if there were any original films from 2019, I made the choice to show six films based on non-original animated series. This edit highlights the absence of nominations for original animated movies at the 2020 Kids Choice Awards.</p>

                    <h3>Every Kids Choice Awards Animated Movie Winner Ranked</h3>
                    <p>This video ranks every winner of the Favorite Animated Movie category of the Kids Choice Awards, a Nickelodeon award show where kids vote on different pieces of entertainment.  Rebeccah ranks the movies from Madagascar (awarded in 2006) to Minions: Rise of Gru (awarded in 2023).  The channel owner wanted me to make a collage in the intro on every announcement of the winner for the animated movies; but I can only find the announcements from 2006, 2007, 2012, and 2020. I also ended the intro with Mario (filmed in 2016 award show) in it as potential winner for 2024.</p>

                    <p>This video is a top 10 ranking based on what Rebeccah considers the best pieces of animation published in 2022, with each series only having one entry.  I only edited the footage of what is shown in the projector and secondary clips that are in full screen with audio in my portions.</p>

                    <p>This is a review on <i>Sonic for Hire</i>, an animated-parody series produced by LowBrow Studios and Rooster Teeth that uses 16-bit and 8-bit renders from video game franchises such as Sonic the Hedgehog and Super Mario.

                    <p>This video ranks all the films created by Blue Sky Studios from the first Ice Age film in 2002 to Ice Age: Buck Wild in 2022.  My edits do not display her character designs used for her videos based on a request to have me edit based on a specific style, so some of the final edits (especially with Ice Age 5) were done by her.</p>

                    <p>This is her review of the DreamWorks movie <i>The Bad Guys</i>.  It is the first video Rebeccah Starlight has posted under the request of a Kofi supporter to pick for a review.  It is also the first video of hers that I made most of the final edits from start to finish.  I have even learned the size of the footage from B-roll that should be displayed from her videos while she is talking.</p>

                    <h3>The Loud House's "Schooled!" Review</h3>
                    <p> This video is a review on the Season 5 premiere of The Loud House, <i>Schooled!</i>,  My edits in this video are mainly about her discussing the plotlines of Lincoln's sisters.  It is the first time my voice has been heard in one of her videos.  It is also the longest piece that I have ever edited at over 27 minutes.  I also give Rebeccah Starlight credit for the audio changes  in 21:59 and 30:09, adding background music, and editing some of the star background without the plus signs.</p>

                    <h3>Disney Canon Films Ranked</h3>
                    <p> This is my first major project with Rebeccah Starlight, as I edited for at least 14 minutes of the video.  This video ranks every Disney film produced in Walt Disney Animation Studios from Snow White in 1937 to Encanto in 2021. Compared to other editors, most of my sections are soundtracks from Kingdom Hearts games (which are also Disney properties).  One of the most interesting things I edited was in the Hercules portion where the first 10 seconds of the ranking was creating an Allen Tsai parody where I cropped visuals of a clip to look more like it would be viewed from a phone in vertical orientation, and add text from what was spoken inside a black textbox. </p>

                    <h3>Best Fairly OddParents Episodes</h3>
                    <p>This is my first project editing for Rebeccah Starlight.  It shows what Starlight believes to be the Top 20 segments from Nickelodeon's <i>Fairly OddParents</i>.  I edited for two of her sections, as a beginner's guide to her.  This helped me get used to her style of videos.</p>

Many of the videos produced by the studio are created by students in the program and published on the Media Crunch YouTube Channel.  I have contributed to FilmAcademy360 since 2015 and am currently working as an intern since 2020.  Throughout my time in FilmAcademy360, I have created my own show on the Youtube Channel called "Jake's Animated Review Show", where I discuss anime.  During my Animated Review Show, I also have a contribution to help with camerawork and editing.</p>

This is one of the most thoroughly planned episodes for my animated review show, as it incorporates me doing different poses and finding different images to show the reference that I pose with.  My favorite portion is renacting the "Approaching Me" scene from Season 2, with some slight tweaks.</p>
